# Cats and dogs
[Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) distinguish images of dogs from cats. 
## About the project
The project is written using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and python 3.5.
The problem is solved using a convolutional neural network. Architecture is inspired by [VVG net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556v6.pdf).
I achieved accuracy in 80% when using 25000 images.
